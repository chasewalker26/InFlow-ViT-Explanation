# InFlow - Explaining ViTs Using Information Flow
The official implementation of the InFlow ViT attribution method from the AISTATS 2025 paper: Explaining ViTs Using Information Flow

 * Official Paper - [AISTATS 2025 Proceedings](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v258/walker25a.html)

## How to Use MDA
See `example.ipynb` for a full example of the application of the MDA source code compared with SOTA ViT attribution methods.

It shows:
<ul>
  <li>Importing and setting up models and images for prediction.</li>
  <li>Generating various ViT attributions. </li>
  <li>Generating an InFlow attribution.</li>
</ul>

## Replicating the Paper Experiments
To replicate the paper experiments, please see the README inside of the `InFlow/experiments` folder.

All experimental data reported in the paper was generated by these tests and the commands in the README.
